    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="long-text">Valeria's necci recipe makes good use of one of Tuscany's finest exports – chestnut flour. These flavourful pancakes are served stuffed with fresh ricotta stirred with chestnut honey for a divine sweet snack, dessert or breakfast dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Necci Batter</h3>
    <ul class="long-text">
        <li>275g of chestnut flour</li>
        <li>250ml of water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing the pan</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>For the Filling</h3>
    <ul class="long-text">
        <li>ricotta, either sheep's or cow's milk</li>
        <li>100g of sugar</li>
        <li>chestnut honey, for drizzling</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="long-text">
        <li>
            In a large bowl, stir the flour with the water and oil to get a smooth, thick-ish batter (it shouldn’t be too runny; adjust flour and water quantities if it’s too runny or too dense)
        </li>
       <li>Heat a drop of oil in a skillet set over a medium heat. Add a couple of spoonfuls of the batter and tilt the pan to spread it evenly</li>
       <li>Cook until you see that the top of the neccio looks dry – for about 2 minutes. Flip it over and cook on the other side for 1 minute more. Transfer to a plate and keep warm. Carry on with the rest of the batter, greasing the skillet in between each addition of batter</li>
       <li>On each neccio, spread a dollop of ricotta stirred with a bit of honey. Roll it up and serve with another drizzle of honey</li>
    </ol>
